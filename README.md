This jupyter notebook trains a neural network model to recognize handwritten digits and letters. This network is trained using the EMNIST balanced dataset. This model achieves an accuracy ~ %86.

The TensorFlow library is used to construct the model.

The data utilized in this repository is available along with the rest of the EMNIST dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/emnist.
